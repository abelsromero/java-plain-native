= Plain Java native

Experimental repo to assess complexity of building a native image only using 'org.graalvm.buildtools.native'.
'base' module is a simple "HelloWorld" project for comparison (see `ci/stats.sh`).

== Setup

. Install Graal (using Liberica NIK to simplify steps)

 sdk i java 22.3.2.r17-nik

. Create Gradle project

 gradle init

. Add plugin and settings repo https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/gradle-plugin.html#_adding_the_plugin

. Compile

 ./gradlew :app:nativeCompile

. Run ðŸš€

 ./app/build/native/nativeCompile/my-app

NOTE: 'app' module also includes 'application' to generate runnable distributions, but that's not required for the native build.

== Testing

One failing and one successful test are included to validate https://junit.org/junit5/[Junit 5] and https://assertj.github.io/doc/[AssertJ].

To run tests in JVM:

 ./gradlew :app:test

To only run tests in native image (ignore `test` or else the native test compile does not run):

 ./gradlew :app:nativeTest -x test

The later will generate a binary with the tests embedded in _./app/build/native/nativeTestCompile/my-app-tests_

== known issue

* Mockito is not supported for native test compilation.
https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata/pull/141

* JCommander requires several classes to be added for reflection (`reflect-config.json`).
Agent can be run with `./gradlew -Pagent app:nativeTest`.
